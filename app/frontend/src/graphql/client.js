/**
 * GraphQL transport (IMDB-4) — the SPA's ONLY network path to data.
 *
 * Talks exclusively to the cosmo federation router. Per
 * docs/architecture.md ("Router authentication from the browser"):
 * every request carries `Authorization: Bearer <Firebase ID token>` from
 * auth.js#getIdToken(), and NO request is attempted while signed out — the
 * guard throws a normalized `auth` error before any network activity.
 * AuthGate makes the signed-out case unreachable in practice; the guard here
 * makes it structural.
 *
 * FIELD-LEVEL GOVERNANCE (IMDB-14): operation documents select governed
 * fields optimistically. Since the router's switch to TRANSPARENT REDACT
 * MODE (governance-platform notice on the IMDB-14 ticket, verified live
 * 2026-07-11, policy revision 8), an operation selecting a denied field
 * succeeds with HTTP 200: the denied fields are simply ABSENT from `data`
 * (alias-aware, per-element in lists), there is no `errors` array, and the
 * machine-readable signal is the top-level response extension
 * `extensions.governance.redactedFields` (`Type.field` coordinates).
 * `executeWithDenials` reads that extension and resolves
 * `{ data, deniedFields }` in ONE round trip — no retry needed. The full
 * optimistic document goes out on every fetch, so a live grant flip shows up
 * on the very next fetch with no code change: the value reappears in `data`
 * and drops out of `redactedFields`.
 *
 * The pre-redact REJECT mode (whole-operation HTTP 403 + PERMISSION_DENIED
 * + extensions.deniedFields, the shape IMDB-4 verified) still exists on the
 * platform for subscriptions and as a config fallback; errors.js keeps
 * normalizing it to kind 'denied' defensively, but it is no longer the
 * primary path and no retry machinery hangs off it.
 *
 * docs/architecture.md § Field-level governance is the source of truth for
 * this contract: it documents transparent redact mode as the primary path
 * (amended by the architect via PR #12) and explicitly retires the earlier
 * strip-and-retry mechanism.
 *
 * Components never import this file — they use the hooks/keys in hooks.js.
